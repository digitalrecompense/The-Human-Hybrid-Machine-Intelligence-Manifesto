PROPRIETARY LICENSE – NO UNAUTHORIZED USE

This document sets forth the terms and conditions under which the 
software and associated materials (collectively, the “Software”) are provided.
The Software is the sole and exclusive property of RAiTHE INDUSTRIES INC.
("Company") and contains trade secrets and confidential information. No
license is granted to any person or entity except as expressly authorized in
writing by the Company.

## 1. No license granted

Absent a separate, written agreement executed by an authorized officer of the
Company, you have **no right to use, install, run, compile, copy, modify,
distribute, translate, publish, or create derivative works of** the Software.
The Software may not be accessed by, or provided to, any third party. Any
attempted use or reproduction without the Company’s express written
permission is strictly prohibited. Proprietary licenses often reserve the
developer’s rights and prohibit reverse engineering, redistribution and
modification; this license goes further by denying all usage rights entirely.

## 2. Authorized internal use

Only employees or contractors of the Company who are expressly authorized in
writing and bound by confidentiality obligations may use the Software, and
only for internal business purposes as directed by the Company. Authorized
users may not share the Software or any results obtained from its use outside
the Company. Even authorized users are prohibited from using the Software to
train or develop competing artificial intelligence systems, or to extract
underlying models, algorithms or data.

## 3. Ownership and confidentiality

The Software, including all source code, object code, models, training data,
designs, algorithms and documentation, is owned exclusively by the Company.
The Software constitutes confidential information and a valuable trade
secret of the Company. You agree to protect the confidentiality of the
Software using at least the same degree of care that you use to protect your
own confidential information, and in no event less than a reasonable degree
of care. You shall not disclose the Software or any portion thereof to any
other person or entity without the Company’s prior written consent.

## 4. Restrictions

Without limiting the foregoing, you shall not and shall not permit any
third party to:

1. **Copy or publish** – copy, reproduce, display, publish or transmit the
   Software or any portion thereof;
2. **Modify or derive** – modify, adapt, translate, merge, enhance or create
   derivative works of the Software;
3. **Disassemble or analyze** – decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, or
   otherwise attempt to derive the source code, architecture, data sets or
   underlying algorithms of the Software;
4. **Distribute or lease** – sell, assign, sublicense, lease, rent, loan,
   disclose or otherwise transfer the Software or any of its rights to any
   third party;
5. **Train AI systems** – use the Software or any output from the Software to
   train, fine‑tune, evaluate or improve any machine learning or artificial
   intelligence model or system;
6. **Benchmark or compete** – use the Software for the purposes of
   benchmarking, developing, marketing or supporting any product or service
   that competes with the Software or any of the Company’s offerings; or
7. **Circumvent controls** – bypass, disable or interfere with any security
   features, usage restrictions or access controls embedded in the Software.

## 5. Termination

Any unauthorized use of the Software automatically terminates any limited
rights you may have and constitutes a material breach of this license. Upon
termination, you must immediately cease all use of the Software and destroy
all copies in your possession. Sections 2–8 survive termination.

## 6. No warranty

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED **“AS IS”** WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. The
Company disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not
limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
non‑infringement and accuracy. Limiting warranties and liability is a
standard practice in proprietary licenses.

## 7. Limitation of liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE
COMPANY OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, OR ANY DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS,
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA OR INFORMATION, OR ANY OTHER PECUNIARY
LOSS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE OR THIS LICENSE, EVEN IF THE
COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE COMPANY’S
AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO THE SOFTWARE SHALL NOT
EXCEED TEN CANADIAN DOLLARS (CAD $10.00).

## 8. Governing law and jurisdiction

This license is governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein,
excluding its conflict‑of‑law rules. Any dispute arising under this license
shall be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in
Toronto, Ontario.

---

*This license draws on standard proprietary license terms such as prohibitions
on reverse engineering and redistribution, but is deliberately stricter: 
no rights are granted and use is limited exclusively to authorized Company personnel.*
